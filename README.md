# web-todo-list
This is a simple Todo List App that allows you to add and delete tasks.
It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and stores the tasks in the browser's local storage.

This is the first version of the app.
In the next version, we plan to add a feature that will allow users to schedule tasks with specific dates,
effectively turning it into a full-fledged planner.

## Features
- Add tasks
- Delete tasks
- Store tasks in the browser's local storage

## Usage
Simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
Add tasks by typing the task description in the input field and clicking the "Add" button.
To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task you want to remove.

## Planned Features for the Next Version
- Task scheduling with specific dates
- Calendar view for better organization and visualization of tasks
